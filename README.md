Hi, My name is Agrima Saxena. 
I am a tech enthusiast and an avid reader with a creative side. I love listening to music, watching web series and sketching. 
I am a spontaneous person who loves to try out new things and is always up for a challenge. Though I am a fast learner, I tend to lose interest in things just as easily.
After completing my degree, I would like to either pursue the line of being a back-end developer or go into research by pursuing Masters in the same subject.
